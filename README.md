# Hand-gesture
This repository contains a Python-based hand gesture recognition project. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize hand gestures in real-time using a webcam. The project is built with the following dependencies:

Requirements
Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed in your environment:

Python: Version 3.x (Project tested with Python 3.8.8)
OpenCV: Version 4.5
Install using:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
MediaPipe: Version 0.8.5
Install using:
bash
Copy code
pip install mediapipe
TensorFlow: Version 2.5.0
Install using:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow
NumPy: Version 1.19.3
Install using:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Features
Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe.
Gesture classification powered by TensorFlow.
Efficient image processing with OpenCV and NumPy.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Install dependencies as mentioned in the requirements section.

Run the script to start the hand gesture recognition system:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Example Output
The system will display a real-time video feed with recognized gestures overlaid on the screen.

Future Improvements
