# Hand-gesture
# This repository contains a Python-based hand gesture recognition project. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize hand gestures in real-time using a webcam. The project is built with the following dependencies:

Requirements
Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed in your environment:

1) Python: Version 3.x (Project tested with Python 3.8.8)

2) OpenCV: Version 4.5
Install using:
* bash : 
* pip install opencv-python

3) MediaPipe: Version 0.8.5
Install using:
* bash: 
* pip install mediapipe

4) TensorFlow: Version 2.5.0
Install using:
* bash : 
* pip install tensorflow

5) NumPy: Version 1.19.3
Install using:
* bash: 
* pip install numpy

# Features
1) Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe.
2) Gesture classification powered by TensorFlow.
3) Efficient image processing with OpenCV and NumPy.

# Usage
Clone the repository:

bash: 
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Install dependencies as mentioned in the requirements section.

# Run the script to start the hand gesture recognition system:

bash
python main.py
Example Output
The system will display a real-time video feed with recognized gestures overlaid on the screen.

# Future Improvements
1) Add support for more complex gestures.
2) Enhance performance and reduce latency.
3) Integrate with external devices or systems for gesture-based control.

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your enhancements.
